# Hello! I’m [Your Name]

I’m a passionate coder and lifelong learner, with a strong interest in programming and web development. I’m comfortable with Python and C, and I’ve also studied Java, HTML, and C++. I dabbled in React a while back, though I’m a bit rusty on it now!

## Why pick me?

I’m someone who values dedication and consistency. I love diving into new technologies and figuring things out. I believe with the right mindset and a lot of hard work, I can contribute meaningfully to any project or community.

## How I’ll contribute to the club

I’m excited to join in on discussions, contribute my skills and ideas, and support my fellow members. Whether it’s coding, brainstorming, or competing in challenges, I’m all in and ready to collaborate.

## What I’m passionate about

My interests lie in software development, algorithms, web technologies, and data visualization. I’m all about learning by doing, so I plan on working on projects and teaming up with others to keep growing.

## Some projects I’ve worked on

Feel free to peek at some of my previous projects:

- [Origami Website Design](https://github.com/suryar2006/PRO-C52-DESIGN-ORIGAMI-WEBSITE---2) — A creative website design project with responsive layouts.
- [Project49](https://github.com/suryar2006/Project49) — Various small programs showcasing problem-solving in Python and C.
- [Project 68](https://github.com/suryar2006/Project-68) — Algorithm and data structure implementations to sharpen my skills.
- [Data Visualization](https://github.com/suryar2006/PRO-C103-DATA-VISUALISATION) — Visualizing data with charts and graphs using JavaScript and Python.

# Task-00: Origami Website Design

## How I approached this

I built a website themed around origami, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I focused on making the site look good on different screen sizes and included interactive elements to engage users.

## What I learned

This project really boosted my front-end skills. Making sure the site worked well on phones and desktops was a tricky but rewarding challenge. It gave me confidence in putting design and functionality together.

# Task-01: Project49

## How I tackled it

This task had me solving various coding challenges focused on problem-solving using Python and C. I aimed for clean, efficient code and made sure to test multiple scenarios to get everything working perfectly.

## Reflection

I found this project great for sharpening my logical thinking and debugging skills. Optimizing the code taught me a lot about writing solutions that not only work but work well.

# Task-02: Project 68 - Algorithms and Data Structures

## My approach

I implemented classic algorithms and data structures using both C++ and Python. I worked on both iterative and recursive methods, paying special attention to how efficient and readable my code was.

## What stayed with me

This was a great deep dive into fundamental computer science concepts. Understanding different ways to solve the same problem helped me improve my problem-solving flexibility.

# Task-03: Data Visualization Project

## What I did

I used JavaScript libraries like D3.js and Python tools to turn data into clear, meaningful charts and graphs. Presenting the data in an easy-to-understand way was my main goal.

## Takeaways

This project really opened my eyes to the power of visual storytelling with data. I learned a lot about handling various data formats and creating visuals that convey insights effectively.
